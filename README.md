# Next steps:

Data engineering tasks:

* Design classes to apply unsupervised algorithms
* Write tests for each function
* Create a python package map
* Include optional arguments in stopwords functions -- I found a good list to be used, but still want to set the option to chose another one


Modeling the data:

* Topic modeling
* Interpret topic modeling
* Coursera Course: apply Logistic Regression;
* Bayesian classification


Ruled based functions:

* Themes based on regular expressions -- I already have a function that does it -- refactoring it


# Plans for this work
* Using in consultancy projects (AME, Unilever, find new partners)

* Write books and articles: Covid, sexuality

* Apply to Recurse Center:
Set to Dec/ 2020
https://www.recurse.com/apply/retreat

* Lectures and courses: PUC-SP

* Master's project 
Spring 2021: Jan/2021 - Dec/2022




# Data Pipeline

Build data processing, and modeling pipelines. Built a 
pipeline and a package to release. The goal is to use this format to gather codes related to each of the following steps. 

Levels:
- Get data: from APIs, scrapers, databases, files
- EDA: exploratory data analysis
- Preprocessing: cleaning, normalizing and vectorizing
- Modeling: select, test, validate,
- Plot
---
In the future:
- Deployment

# Theory: Linguistics and NLP
This is a repository to study NLP -- also my way to organize my coding learning.


Theory readings:
* On Chomsky and the Two Cultures of Statistical Learning
http://norvig.com/chomsky.html
* Michael Silverstein: helped define the field of sociolinguistics
> * Language in Culture: The Semiotics of Interaction (Masterclass)
