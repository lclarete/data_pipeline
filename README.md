# Data Pipeline

After feeling stuck for a whole day, I finally get this rep. 
I went over my short-whole coding experience to come up with the basic elements I need daily in order to perform my job.

I'm still insecure if it is the best structure to build, but I'm going to follow this one anyway. The reason for this feeling is the pressure of my first attempt to organize an entire data pipeline for my self. The goal is to use this format to gether codes related to each of its steps. 
I'll be working in a daily basis to improve it.

Levels:
- Get data: from APIs, scrapers, databases, files
- EDA: exploratory data analysis
- Preprocessing: cleaning and normalizing
- Modeling
- Plot

This mind map has helped me with the structural concept.
