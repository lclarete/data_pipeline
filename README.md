# Next steps:

Data engineering tasks:

* Fix the fit method inside the pre_processing class
* Test the supervised class
* Design classes to apply unsupervised algorithms
* Write tests for each function
* Create a python package map
* Include optional arguments in stopword functions -- I found a good list to be used, but still want to set the option to chose another one


Modeling the data:

* Topic modeling
* Interpret topic modeling
* Coursera Course: apply Logistic Regression;
* Bayesian classification


Ruled based functions:

* Themes based on regular expressions -- I already have a function that does it -- refactoring it


# Data Pipeline

Build data processing, and modeling pipelines. Built a 
pipeline and a package to release. The goal is to use this format to gether codes related to each of the following steps. 

Levels:
- Get data: from APIs, scrapers, databases, files
- EDA: exploratory data analysis
- Preprocessing: cleaning and normalizing
- Modeling
- Plot

# Theory: Linguistics and NLP
This is a repository to study NLP -- also my way to organize my coding learning.


Theory readings:
* On Chomsky and the Two Cultures of Statistical Learning
http://norvig.com/chomsky.html
* Michael Silverstein: helped define the field of sociolinguistics
> * Language in Culture: The Semiotics of Interaction (Masterclass)
